1. **What does the term application management mean?**
Application management (AM) is the process of managing the operation, maintenance, versioning, and upgrading of an application through its life cycle.
It includes best practices, techniques and procedures that are critical for any deployed application's optimal operation, performance, and efficiency throughout the enterprise and back-end IT infrastructure

##

2. Who are the key stakeholders of application management?

* **Application owners** 
THese are key business executive personnel who view Application management in terms of business productivity, revenue and control

* **Application developers/managers**
These are key IT enterprise personnel responsable for application development, deployment and maintenance

* **Application testers**
These key IT enterprise personnel responsible for testing, validating and certifying an application for production

* **Application users**
THses are end user of an application. For them, Application management is measured according to security, privacy, versioning, and overall control of application processes and modules

##

3. **What are the typical stages of application life cycle management?  Please describe each stage.**

* **Gather requirements** 
Here the business identify the functional and business process requirements for the change or new application

* **Design**
In this phase, the design team translate the requirement into a technical solution.

* **Build, integrate, test**
In this phase, all the components and flows are developed and tested both individual and in integration with the system to uncover

* **Implement, deploy**
This covers the rollout of the new application. The application module are first put into production libraries. Then any customer training required to effectively and efficiently use the new facilities is provided

* **Operate**
Here you monito and measure the application in the following areas: 
 a. Addressing changes in regulatory requirements
 b. Fixing flaws uncoverd in the application
 c. Monitoring service levels
 d. Measuring and reporting application performance

* **Optimize**
Here IT management uses past measurement and in-house heuristics to seeek ways to optimize existing applications. Areas od concern include performance, capacity utilization, and user satisfaction and productivity

##

4. What does TCO stand for, and what does it mean?
**Total Cost of Ownership** -- is an analysis to determine all the lifetime cost that follow from owning certain kinds of assets

##

5.  **What are the steps of an effective APM (Application Performance Management) strategy according to Gartner?  Please describe each step.**

* **End user experience monitoring**
The first is to capture both qualitative and quantitative elements of user experience.

* **Runtime application architecture discovery, modeling and display**
The second step is to study the software and hardware components involved in appliaction execution, as well as their communication path, to stablishe the potential scope of the problem

* **User-defined transaction profiling**
In this step, you reconrd user-defined transactions and analyze them to identify the source of the problem.

* **Component deep-dive monitoring in an application context**
The fourth step is about conducting deep-dive monitoring of the resources consumed by and events ocurring withing the components found in step 2

* **Analytics**
Finnaly yiu use analytics to crunch the data generated in the first four steps, discover meaninful and actionable patterns, pinpoint the root cause of the problem


##

6. What does COTS stand for, and what does it mean? Give some examples of COTS.
**Commercial Off The Shell** and it refers to a software or hardware item that is commercially available for leasing, licensing or sale to the general public in its original form 

##

7. What is ModSecurity? Highlight some of its salient features.
ModeSecurity is an open source software web application firewall (WAF). A WAF is a firewall that monitors, filters, or block data packages as they are transiting from a web application. Some of the features are:
a. Real time security application
b. Virtual Patching
c. Complete bidirectional HTT traffic logging

##

8.  **Describe the benefits of EUDAs.**

* **Convinience and ease of use**
EUDAs can be developed easily and quickly by non-IT staff to meet the requirements of the end users

* **Powerful tools and technology aware end user**
End-user tools offer rich functionality, including the ability to connect to corporate data sources

* **Demand for more and more information**
Traditionally, manager were often contrained by standard report in the IT system that failed to meet all management information and reporting requirement

##

9. **Describe the main risks related to EUDAs.**

* **Errors**
Errors can occur in any stage

* **Poor version and change control**
EUDAs do not follow a standard method of development and thus, they can be more difficult to control

* **Poor documentatio**
EUDAs generally have poor o no documentation

* **Lack of security**
Users are more interested in getting their problem solve than in evaluating security

* **Lack of audit trail** 
EUDAs are mostly unaudited. THe ability to audit and control changes to key data is essential both for internal governance and for compliance with external regulation

* **Regulatory and compliance violations**
A host of regulations deal with security for which the enterprise is responsable

* **Unknow risk**
THe greatesr operation risk with the use of EUDAs is not knowing the magnitud and severity of a potential problem

* **Opportunity Cost**
Scarce resources may be wasted on developing these applications

##

10. **What are the elements in the security framework for EUDAs? Please describe each element.**

* **Governance**
As part of good governance, senior executive must define that constitutes a EUDA

* **People**
It is the duty key stakeholder to properly manage and control EUDAs and thus there should be a proper process to identify them

* **Process**
There should be a proper process for assessing the security of an EUDA

* **Technology**
From a technology point of view, an organization should perform an assessment to identify tools and techniques needed to support the development of EUDA

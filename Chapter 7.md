# Chapter 7

1. Enumerate and briefly describe the four subtopics of physical asset management, according to the SGP.
* Hardware life cycle management
Encompase the management of hte entire life ccyle of hardware that is used to support enterprise information systems

* Office Equipment
This covers peripheral devices such as printer, scanners, fax machines and multifunction devices

* Industrial control systems
This covers ecurity issue relared systems that monitore or control physical activities such as  temperature, presure and velocity

* Mobile computing
This deals with security issues related to the use of mobile devices in an enterprise

2. Which three subcategories of assets are considered part of hardware, according to the SGP?
* Physical Assets
* Embedded software withing a physical asset
* Operating system that support any embedded software 


 ##
 ***

3. **What factors advocate for the adoption of a well-drafted hardware life cycle management policy?**
* The hardware asset should be retained until cost of operating it is lower than productivity, increased downtome, worker safety, and elevated levels of user dissatisfaction
* Organizations not following any hardware asset management are often frustrated by the communication gaps that allow assets to be lost , acquisitions to be made when spares are in the warehouse, or upgradeds failing due to imcomplete information. 
* Hardware life cycles are vendor dependent
* Every hardware asset brings itw own set of threats. An organization can reduce risk by having and using the tools to properly track and manage its hardware
* There is a need to map hardware with the applications installed on the hardware for software compliance management and reporting.

4. **What are the steps that an organization must follow to develop an ideal acquisition system for hardware assets? Please describe them.**
* Request and approval
This includes applications of standards, redeployment, and initiation of a purchase, if appropiate

* Vendor relationships 
This include creation of contracts and management of vendor relationships

* Acquisition
This includes contract negotiations and contract execution

* Receipt 
This triggers initiating payment of invoices and creating an incident to configure and deliver to the correct individual/location/department

5. What is the best way to manage hardware equipment after its deployment?

* By doing preventive maintanance.
* Track key hardware assets
* All hardware must be properly monitore and measure on all key parameters
* Hardware should be service on a regular basis, and it must be assesses on safety norms after each service

 ##

6. Describe three potential sources of vulnerabilities in MFDs (multifunctional device):

* Print, fax and copy/scan logs
* Address books
* Mailboxes

 ##
 ***
 
7. Define media sanitization and list three actions for sanitization.
* **Media sanitization** is a process of rendering access to target data (the datat subject to the sanitization technique) on the media infeasible for a given level of recovery effort
* Clear
* Purge
* Destroy

8. **Please list and describe the principal elements of an ICS.**
* Sensor 
A sensor measures some phenomenon of a physical, chemical, or biological domain and delivers an electronic signal proportional to the observed characteristic

* Actuator
An actuator receives an electronic signal from a controller and responds by interacting with its enviroment to induce a change in behavior of a physical, chemical or biological entity

* Controller
The controller interprets the signals and generates corresponding manipulated variables, based on a control algorithm and target set points, which it transmits to the actuators. The controller is devoid of intelligece and needs a human-machine interface for direction

* Human-Machine Interface
Operators and engineers use human interfaces to monitor and configure set points , control algorithms, and adjust and stablish parameters in the controller

* Remote diagnostic and maintenance
Diagnostic and maintenance utilities are used to prevent, identify and recover from abnoraml operations or failures

9. How do IT systems differ from ICSs in terms of performance requirements?

	AN IT system is non real time, whereas an ICS is hard real time. 


 ##
 ***
 
10. **List and describe security threats to an ICS (incident command system).**

* Disruption of service due to block or delayed flow of information through ICS networks
* Unauthorized changes to instruction, commands, or alarm tresholds, which could damage, disable  or shut down the equipment; create enviroment impacts or endanger human life
* Inaccurate information sent to system operators, either to disgise unauthorized changes or to cause the operators to initate inappropiated actions, which could have various negative effects
* ICS software or configuration setting modified, or ICS software infected with malware, which could have various negative effects
* Financial losses due to interference with the operation of equipment protection system, which could endanger constly and difficult-to-replace equipment
* Danger to human life due to interference witht eh safety operation

11. What does the term mobile device technology stack mean?
It has 4 layers

* Hardware
* Firmware
* Mobile operating system
* Application


 ##
 ***
 
12. **What are the major security concerns related to mobile devices according to SP 800-14?**

* Lack of physical security controls
* Use of untrusted mobile devices
* Use of untrusted networksUse of applications created by unknow parties
* Interaction with other systems
* Use of untrusted content
* Use of location services

 ##
 ***
 
13.  What is AppVet?
Is a tool developed by NIST that provides automated management support of the app testing and app approval or rejection activities.
AppVet facilitates the app vetting workflow by providing an intuitive user interface for submitting and testing app managing reports and assessing risk

# Quiz

1. Any organization should adop a well drafted hardware file cycle management policy, considering the following reasons:

* Organizations not following any hardware asset management are often frustrated by the communication gaps that allow assets to be lost, acquisitions to be made when spares are in the warehouse, or upgrades failing due to incomplete information. All this swells operation cost and hits the top business line.

# Chapter 3

1. Why is risk assessment needed in an organization?
Because enables an organization to determine an appropiated budget for security and implement appropiate security controls that optimize the level of protection while not overshooting the budget


#

2. Explain the term residual risk and provide an example.
Residual risk is the remaining portion of a threat after all efforts to identify and eliminate risk have been made


#

3. Differentiate between a threat and a vulnerability.
A threat is a capabioity of  a threar source to intentionally or accidentally trigger vulnerabilities in the system. A vulnerability is a weakness or potential and intentional entry point in a system. 

Vulnerabilities can be in security procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls.

A threat that cashes in on a potent vulnerability will produce a security violation, or breach


#

4.**What are the four factors that determine risk, and how are they related to each other?**

* **Assets**
Anything that can be given a monetary value

* **Threats**
Any risk that has  a potential to damage an asset is a threat

* **Vulnerability**
Any trapdoor or unintended weak point of a system is a vulnerability

* **Control**
A control is an action to stop a potential threat from causing damage

#

5. Differentiate between qualitative and quantitative risk assessment.

A **Qualitative Risk Assessment** prioritizes the identified risk using predefined rating scale (1 to 10, 1 to 7, etc). Risk are score base on their probability or likelihood of ocurring (0 to 1) and the impact on project objectives should they occur

A **Quantitative Risk Assessment** is a purelly mathematical approach to prioritizing risk by calculating/deriving a numerical or quantitative rating for each risk and then summing up and normalizing to arriving at overall risk


#

6. **Explain key ingredients of a risk analysis worksheet.**

* **Security Issues**
This  gives a brief statement of the security issues or are of concern as well as a description of compliance issues

* **Likelihood**
This is estimate (by internal experts or using past history or heuristics) likelihood for an occurrence of the linked thread/vulnerability pair

* **Impact**
This is the estimate impact (finantial/temporary spatioal) for the linked vulnerability/vulnerability pair

* **Risk Level**
This is assessed according to the matrix 
<img src=a5355c6e20d4695cb79011e639a23bba.png>

* **Recommended Security controls**
These are specific security controls recommended by the team

* **Control Priorities**
These are the relative priorities of the recommended controls

* **Comments**
This is a relevant note for the security risk management decision-making process linked with security issues

#

7. Explain the six stages of the information security risk management process.

* **Context establishment**
Here you set the basics criteria necessary for information security risk management, define the scope and boundries, and stablish an appropiate organiaztion operating the information security risk

* **Risk Assessment**
Here you identify the risk to analyze it throughly and then to evaluate the risk against establish metrics to categorized for further actions

* **Risk Acceptance**
The risk post threat process should be explicitly communicated to managers/decision makers with the caveat that it cannot reduce further and should be accepted

* **Risk Communication and consultation**
This is the continual and iterative proceess an organization follows to provide, share, or obtain information about the risk and to keep updating or taking feedback from the key stakeholders regarding the management of risk

* **Risk Monitoring**
This stage involve continuous monitoring and review of all risk information obtained from the risk management activities

#

8. Name the four risk-related standard documents that are published by The Open Group.

* The Open Group Standar: Risk Taxonomy (2013)
* The Open Group Technical Guide: REquirements for Risk Assessment Methodologies (2009)
* The Open Group Technical Guide: FAIR-ISO/IEC 27005 Cookbook (2010)
* The Open Group Risk Analysis (O-RA) Technical Standard (2013)

#

9. How does FAIR define key terms related to risk assessment? Is it more or less specific than ISO 27005 in its definitions pertaining to risk analysis?

* **Asset**
Any data, device, or other component of the environment that involves information and that can be illicitly accessed, used, disclosed, altered, destroyed, and/ or stolen, resulting in loss

* **Risk**
The probable frequency and probable impacrt of future loss

* **Threat**
Any entity capable of harming an asset and/or organization partially or permanetly

* **Vulnerability**
The probability of an asset's liability to resist actions of a threat agent

#

10. **Regarding risk assessment, what are the different types of assets? Please explain them.**

* **Hardware Assets**
This includes physical servers, workstations, laptops, mobile devices, removable media, PDA devices, television sets, and networking and telecomunications equipment

* **Software Assets**
This includes applications, operating system and other system software, virtual machine and container virtualization software, software for software-define networks, and network function virtualization, database management systems, decision support systems and analytics engine

* **Information Assets**
This includes assts directly connected with information or its storage (ex: databases, file systems, cloud storage, routing information)

* **Business Assets**
This category includes all other organization assets (human capital, business processes, factory location) that don't fit in the preceding categories. It also inclide intagible assets such as organizaition control, know-how, reputation, and image of rthe organization


#

11. Explain the STRIDE threat model and provide an example.

STRIDE is a threat classification system developed by microsoft to categorized deliberately planned attacks. For ex: identity spoofing, data tampering, repudiation , DoS, etc

#

12. **List twenty common cybersecurity threat forms.**

* Malware
* Virus
* Worm
* Ransomeware
* Spam
* Trojan horse
* Trapdoor
* Exploits
* Spam Programs
* Flooders
* Zombies/bots
* Spyware
* Adware
* DNS Attacks
* DoS Attacks
* Remore Access Attacks
* Phishing
* Sniffing
* Webside Exploit
* Password Attacks

#

13. What are the three key themes of the Threat Horizon 2019 report?

* **Disruption**
This can cause by overreliance on existing connectivity and planning processes of doing business

* **Distortion**
Once information integrity is lost, the monitoring of access and changes to sensitive information will become critical

* **Deterioration**
This occurs whjen controls are dictated by regulations and technology bringing a heightened focus on risk assessment and management in light of regulatory changes and the increased prevalence of artificial intelligence in everydat technology

#

14. How does the FAIR risk analysis document group severity controls?

* **Avoidance Controls**
* **Deterrent Controls**
* **Vulnerability Controls**
* **Responsive Controls**

#

15. According to ISO 27005, what are viable options for any system that treats risk?
* Risk Reduction or Mitigation
* Risk Retention
* Risk Avoidance
* Risk Transfer or Sharing

#

16. What elements comprise the scope of rick assessment?

* Services
* Assets
* Factors influencing impact ratings

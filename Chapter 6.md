# Chapter 6

1. **The ISF's SGP divides information management into four topics. What are they?**

* Information classification and handling
* Privacy
* Documents and records
* Sensitive physical informatiom


## 
***
2. **Explain the NIST risk management framework’s six-step approach to managing overall risk.**

* **Categorization**
Here you identify information that will be transmitted, processed, or stored by the system and define applicable levels of information categorization based on an impact analysis

* **Selection**
Here you select an initial set of baseline security controls for the system, based on the security categorization, and the tailor and supplement the security control baseline as needed

* **Implementation**
Here you implement security controls and docuemnts how the controls are used wihthing the system and its environment of operation

* **Assessment**
Here you assess the security controls by using appropiate assessment procedures and try to determine the extent to which  the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desire outcome with respect to meetign the security requiremtns for the system

* **Aurhorize**
Thi is about formal authority by the system to operate or ontinue to operate based on the results of the security control assessment.

* **Monitor**
Here you persistently monitor security controls to ensure that they are effective over time ans changes occur in the system and the environment in which the system operates

3. **How does FIPS 199 define security categories?**

SC information type = { (confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact) }

## 
***
4. **Explain the four steps of the security categorization process included in NIST SP 800-60.**
* Identity information types
* Select provisional impact leves
* Review and adjust provisional impact levels
* Assign system security category

## 
***
5. **Name three sources suggested by SP 800-60 that define individual information types.**

* Mission-based infromation
* Services delivery support functions
* Back support fucntions

## 
***
6. **Explain the term privacy from an information point of view.**
In the context of information, the term privacy refers to making valuable private information about an individual unavailable to parties who have no permission as well as no direct need for that information

## 
***
7. **Does privacy have the same meaning as information security?**
The two term are related, **Information Security** can protect **privacy**

**Information security** provides protection for all types of information, in any form, so that the information's confidentiality, integrity, and availability are maintained.

**Privacy** assures that personal information is collected, processed (used), protected, and destroyed legally and fairly as per prevailing law of land

## 
***
8. * **In today’s information scenario, what are some possible types of threats in the information collection process?**
* _Surveillance_
This is the wathching, listening to, or recording of an individual's activities without his or her consent or knowledge. This can be problematic and a violation to the right to privacy

* _Interrogation_
This is the act of pressuring an individual to divulge information by application of force (physical or mental). For example in certain fields in a form or in an inline registration process are required in order to proceed, the individual is compell, or at least pressured to divulge information

## 
***
9. **How can privacy be violated at the information processing stage?**

* Aggregation
* Identification
* Insecurity
* Second Use
* Exclusion

## 
***
10. * **List some potential privacy threats that may occur as information is being disseminated.**
* _Disclosure_ 
Refers to the public release of authentic personal information about an individual

* _Breach of confidentiality_
This is a disclosure that involves the violation of trust in a relationship

* _Exposure_
THis involves the exposing to others of certain physical and emotional attributes about a person, such as nude photograph or a video of an operation

* _Increased Accessibility_
This involves the exposing to others of certain physical and emotional attibutes about a person

* _Blackmail_
Blackmail involves the threat of disclousure. Ransomeware is an example of blackmail

* _Appropriation_
This involves the use of a person's identity or personality for the purpose of another

* _Distortion_
This refers to the manipulation of the way a person is perceived and judged by others and involves the victim being inaccurately expose to the public

## 
***
11. **What kind of privacy threats are exposed by invasions?**
* Intrusion
* Decisional interference

## 
***
12. * **Enumerate and briefly explain key principles of the GDPR.**
* _Fair, Lawful and Transparent Processing_

* _Purpose Limitation_

* _Data  Minimization_

* _Accuracy_

* _Data Retention Periods_

* _Data Security_

* _Accountability_

## 
***
13. **How does NIST SP 800-53 organize privacy controls?**
* Authority and purpose
* Accountability, audit, and risk management
* Data quality and integrity
* Data minimization
* Individual participation and redress
* Security
* Transparency
* Use limitation

## 
***
14. **Differentiate between the terms document and record.**

A document might be a record, but not all documents are record. Is a work in progress

A record is an official file that clearly delineates terms and conditions, statements

## 
***
15. **What is the life cycle of a record?**

* Active
* Semi Active
* Inactive

## 
***
16. * **What are some supporting technologies that can be used to protect sensitive physical information?**
* Closed-circuit television (CCTV)
* Locks
* Alarms
* Access control
* Vaulting
* Inteligence report
* First responder interfaces
* Fire protection systems
* Time locks
* Physical access solutions

## 
***
17. **What are some key issues in securing physical information throughout its life cycle?**

* Identify and document
* Classification
* Label
* Storage
* Secure Transport
* Disposal

## 
***
18.  **What is GDPR**
The General Data Protection Regulation

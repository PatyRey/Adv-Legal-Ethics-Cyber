# Chapter 1

1. Explain briefly each of the following terms from the perspective of cybersecurity: availability, integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation, confidentiality.

* **Availability :** The property of system or system resource being accessible,or usable or operational upon request

*  **Integrity :** This means maintenance of consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data over its entire life cycle

*   **Authenticity :** This is the property of being genuine and being ablr yo be verified and trusted

* **Non-repudiation:** This is a legal assurance that the sender of information is provided with proof of delivery. and the recipient is provided with proof of the sender's identity, so neither can later deny having processes the information  

* **Confidentiality :** This is privacy. It is a set of rules that limits access to information

#
2. * **What are the major key challenges in developing an effective cybersecurity system? and explain each one in details.**

* **Scale and complexity of Cyber Space**
* **Nature of threat**
* **Trade-off between user needs and security implementations** 
#

* The Nature of the threat will come from:
**Internal sources and external sources **
#

3. * **What are the major technologies commonly implemented for cybersecurity in large organization?**
* Cryptography
* Firewalls
* Network security protocols
* Antivirus protection

#

4. * **What are the major activities of the Information Security Forum (ISF)?**
Is the ingoing development of the Standard of Good Practice for Information Security (SGP)

#
* What document is a focuse reference guide for enterprise to identify and manage information security risk in their operations supply chain:
**Standar of Good Practice (SGP)** 

#

5. What are the three key activities for information security as per the Standard of Good Practice for Information Security?
* Planning for Cybersecurity
* Managing the cybersecurity
* Assesment of Security

 #

6. Explain what the term ISMS stands for and what it means:

**Information Security Management System** and is a set of policies and procedures for systematically managing an organization's sensitive data. Is primary implemented to minimize all risk and ensure business continuity by proactively limiting the impact of a security breach

#

7. * **What are the core functions in the NIST cybersecurity framework? and explain them.**

* **Identification**
This implies development of organizational understanding of management of cybersecurity risk to system, assets, data, and capabilities

* **Protection**
This implies development and implementation of appropiate safeguard for ensuring delivery of critical infraestructure service

* **Detection**
This implies development and implementation of appropiate activities for identification of any occurence of a cybersecurity event

* **Respond**
This implies the development and implementation of appropiated activities for taking action regarding a detected cybersecurity event

* **Recovery**
This implies development and the appropiation of activities needed for maintenance of plans for resiliance and for restoration of capabilities or services impaired due to a cybersecurity event

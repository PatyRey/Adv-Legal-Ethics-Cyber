***1. Define a security audit.***
**security audit** - An independent review and examination of a system’s records and activities to determine the adequacy of
system controls, ensure compliance with established
security policy and procedures, detect breaches in security
services, and recommend any changes that are indicated for countermeasures.

**2. List some of the auditable items suggested in the X.816 model of security audits and alarms.**
*X.816 suggests the auditing the following:*
	**Security events related to a specific connection:**
	■ Connection requests
	■ Connection confirmed
	■ Disconnection requests
	■ Disconnection confi rmed
	■ Statistics appertaining to the connection
	**Security events related to the use of security services:**
	■ Security service requests
	■ Security mechanisms usage
	■ Security alarms
	**Security events related to management:**
	■ Management operations
	■ Management notifications
**The list of auditable events should include at least the following:**
	■ Deny access
	■ Authenticate
	■ Change attribute
	■ Create object
	■ Delete object
	■ Modify object
	■ Use privilege
	
**3. Describe security performance functions.**
 *Security performance function as comprising three areas:*
	■ **Security monitoring and reporting:** Consists of *monitoring* security performance regularly *and reporting* to specific audiences, such as executive management
	■ **Information risk reporting:** Consists of producing reports relating to *information risk* and presenting *reporting* to executive management on a regular basis
	■ **Information security compliance monitoring:** Consists of information security controls derived from regulatory and *legal drivers and contracts*, used to *monitor security compliance*

**4. Describe the three broad uses of security metrics.**

■ **Strategic support:** Assessments of security properties can be used to aid in different kinds of decision making, such as program planning, resource allocation, and product and service selection.

■ **Quality assurance:** Security metrics can be used during the software development life cycle to eliminate vulnerabilities, particularly during code production, by performing functions such as measuring adherence to secure coding standards, identifying vulnerabilities that are likely to exist, and tracking and analyzing security flaws that are eventually discovered.

■ **Tactical oversight:** Monitoring and reporting of the security status or posture of an IT system can be carried out to determine compliance with security requirements (for example, policies, procedures, regulations), gauge the effectiveness of security controls and manage risk, provide a basis for trend analysis, and identify specific areas for improvement.

**5. List the views of implementing the monitoring and reporting function based on the security performance metrics. (per SP 800-55) **

**1. Prepare for data collection.** In essence, this step involves the metrics development
process shown in Figure 18.2.
**2. Collect data and analyze results.** The analysis should identify gaps between actual and desired performance, identify reasons for undesired results, and identify areas that require improvement.
**3. Identify corrective actions.** Based on step 2, determine appropriate corrective actions and prioritize them based on risk mitigation goals.
**4. Develop business case.** This involves developing a cost model for each corrective action and making a business case for taking that action.
**5. Obtain resources.** Obtain the needed budget and resource allocation.
**6. Apply corrective actions**. These actions may include adjustments in management, technical, and operational areas.	

**6. List the generic steps for security compliance monitoring.**

1. *Identify key stakeholders* and/or partners across the organization who regularly deal with institutional compliance issues (for example, legal, risk management,
privacy, audit).
2. *Identify key standards,* regulations, contractual commitments, and other areas that address specific requirements for security and privacy.
3. Perform a *high-level gap analysis* of each compliance requirement that is applicable to determine where progress needs to be made.
4. Develop a prioritized action plan that will help organize *remedial* efforts.
5. Develop a compliance policy, standard, roles and responsibilities, and/or procedures
*in collaboration with other key stakeholders*.
